# Commands

The command tree splits into three groups. The shared API (mailbox, envelope, flag, message, attachment) is the cross-protocol least-common-denominator surface, behaving the same whatever backend serves the active account. The protocol-specific APIs (imap, jmap, gmail, msgraph, maildir, m2dir, smtp) each expose the full surface of one backend, including operations the shared API cannot model. The meta commands (account, completion, manual) cover account configuration, shell completions and man pages.

### Requirement: Shared commands over a selected backend
The shared commands SHALL run over an `EmailClient` that owns one backend-client variant per compiled-in backend. It selects the first configured storage backend the global `--backend` flag allows, preferring local backends over network ones, plus an optional SMTP transport for storage backends that cannot send (IMAP, Maildir, m2dir). Each shared method matches the active backend and calls its per-protocol adapter.

### Requirement: Protocol commands ignore backend selection
Each protocol command SHALL build its own `<Proto>Client` via a `build_<proto>_client` helper and run against that backend directly, ignoring `--backend`. The imap command mirrors IMAP's flat command list; gmail and msgraph track their REST resource domains; the filesystem backends expose only operations that map to their on-disk layout, leaving MIME rendering to the shared commands.

### Requirement: Raw passthrough is byte-verbatim
The `imap raw` and `smtp raw` commands SHALL forward the command bytes to the server verbatim, resolving the argument through the shared `RawCommandArg` (positional or stdin). It decodes literal `\r` / `\n` escapes into real CRLF so a shell-typed command survives intact. `imap raw` sends a batch of caller-tagged commands: it appends a trailing CRLF when missing and delegates tagging, framing and out-of-order completion tracking to io-imap. `smtp raw` stays a single command line: it strips the trailing CRLF (io-smtp appends its own) and rejects a multi-line batch, since the SMTP exchange reads exactly one reply.

### Requirement: Account threaded as a sibling argument
The active account context SHALL be threaded as a sibling argument through every `execute` chain, never reached through the client. Subcommands receive `account` and `client` side by side.

### Requirement: Output discipline
Data and errors SHALL go to stdout through the printer; `--json` switches every command to JSON. stderr carries logs only. Each command's doc comment is its `--help` text, so `himalaya <command> --help` is the canonical per-command usage reference.

### Requirement: Data commands serialize their data
A command returning data SHALL hand the printer a dedicated output type implementing both `Display` and `Serialize`, and register its JSON Schema under the command's invocation key. `Message` is reserved for confirmations, since it serializes as a single `message` string and leaves `--json` unparseable. Where a sibling `list` already serializes a backend resource, the `get` output SHALL emit that resource verbatim through a transparent newtype, so one item read with `get` has the shape of one row of `list`. Where the wire type is unsuitable (a recursive MIME tree, a type carrying no schema), the output type SHALL name its fields instead.

### Requirement: Serialized collections are always present
An output field holding a collection SHALL be serialized even when empty, because the schema marks it required regardless and a skipped field would contradict the published schema.

### Requirement: Gmail header selection applies to every format
`gmail messages get --header` and `gmail threads get --header` SHALL narrow the rendered headers whatever the requested format. Gmail honours its `metadataHeaders` parameter under the metadata format alone and returns every header otherwise, so the narrowing SHALL also be applied to the response. Matching is case-insensitive, order and repeats are preserved, and passing no `--header` renders every header. Headers are read from the top-level payload part, where Gmail puts the RFC 5322 headers.

### Requirement: Raw message formats write bytes
A Gmail `get` command asked for the raw format SHALL decode the fetched message and write its RFC 5322 bytes through the shared byte writer rather than rendering a summary. This covers `messages get` and `drafts get`.

### Requirement: One module per subcommand
A protocol command resource SHALL live in a sibling module file carrying its `pub mod` declarations and its `Command` enum, next to a folder holding one file per subcommand. Types live with the subcommand that owns them; a type serving several subcommands lives in the file of the one that owns it, or in its own module when it belongs to none.

### Requirement: Command types carry a domain and a target
A protocol command type SHALL be named `<Domain><Target><Verb>Command`, so a bare verb is never a type name. The domain prefix stays wherever the bare name would collide across the backends a CLI spans, and is otherwise omitted for the tables and value enums under the cli subtree.

### Requirement: Composers default the From header
`messages compose`, `messages reply` and `messages forward` SHALL fill the `From` header from the resolved account when `--from` is not passed: `email` as the address, `display-name` as the name it carries. An explicit `--from` SHALL win whole, the configured name never being grafted onto an address the user spelled out. With neither, the header SHALL be omitted rather than guessed.

The name SHALL be handed to the MIME builder apart from the address, so that a name carrying a comma, a quote or a non-ASCII character is encoded by the builder rather than by a quoting rule of Himalaya's own.

### Requirement: Raw message input is shared
A command taking a raw RFC 5322 message SHALL resolve it through the shared `MessageArg`: a file path, an inline value after `--`, or piped stdin. The resolved message is normalised to CRLF and rejected when empty, so no backend receives a zero-length message.
