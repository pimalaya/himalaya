## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: A JMAP send files the message as sent
A JMAP send SHALL stage the message in the drafts mailbox with `$draft`, then submit it with an `onSuccessUpdateEmail` patch (RFC 8621 section 7.5) moving it to the sent mailbox, unsetting `$draft` and setting `$seen`. The drafts mailbox SHALL be `jmap.drafts-mailbox-id`, else the `drafts`-role one, the send failing without either; the sent mailbox SHALL be `jmap.sent-mailbox-id`, else the `sent`-role one, the message only losing `$draft` without either.
