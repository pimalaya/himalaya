# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

The Himalaya CLI scope has changed. It does not include anymore the synchronization, nor the envelope watching. These scopes have moved to dedicated projects:

- [Neverest CLI](https://github.com/pimalaya/neverest), CLI to synchronize, backup and restore emails
- [Mirador CLI](https://github.com/pimalaya/mirador), CLI to watch mailbox changes

### Added

- Added `message edit` command to edit a message. To edit on place (replace a message), use `--on-place`.
- Added `account.list.table.preset` global config option, `accounts.<name>.folder.list.table.preset` and `accounts.<name>.envelope.list.table.preset` account config options.

  These options customize the shape of tables, see examples at [`comfy_table::presets`](https://docs.rs/comfy-table/latest/comfy_table/presets/index.html). Defaults to `"||  |-|||           "`, which corresponds to [`comfy_table::presets::ASCII_MARKDOWN`](https://docs.rs/comfy-table/latest/comfy_table/presets/constant.ASCII_MARKDOWN.html).

- Added `account.list.table.name-color` config option to customize the color used for the accounts' `NAME` column (defaults to `green`).
- Added `account.list.table.backends-color` config option to customize the color used for the folders' `BACKENDS` column (defaults to `blue`).
- Added `account.list.table.default-color` config option to customize the color used for the folders' `DEFAULT` column (defaults to `reset`).
- Added `accounts.<name>.folder.list.table.name-color` account config option to customize the color used for the folders' `NAME` column (defaults to `blue`).
- Added `accounts.<name>.folder.list.table.desc-color` account config option to customize the color used for the folders' `DESC` column (defaults to `green`).
- Added `accounts.<name>.envelope.list.table.id-color` account config option to customize the color used for the envelopes' `ID` column (defaults to `red`).
- Added `accounts.<name>.envelope.list.table.flags-color` account config option to customize the color used for the envelopes' `FLAGS` column (defaults to `reset`).
- Added `accounts.<name>.envelope.list.table.subject-color` account config option to customize the color used for the envelopes' `SUBJECT` column (defaults to `green`).
- Added `accounts.<name>.envelope.list.table.sender-color` account config option to customize the color used for the envelopes' `FROM` column (defaults to `blue`).
- Added `accounts.<name>.envelope.list.table.date-color` account config option to customize the color used for the envelopes' `DATE` column (defaults to `dark_yellow`).
- Added `accounts.<name>.envelope.list.table.unseen-char` account config option to customize the char used for unseen envelopes (defaults to `*`).
- Added `accounts.<name>.envelope.list.table.replied-char` account config option to customize the char used for replied envelopes (defaults to `R`).
- Added `accounts.<name>.envelope.list.table.flagged-char` account config option to customize the char used for flagged envelopes (defaults to `!`).
- Added `accounts.<name>.envelope.list.table.attachment-char` account config option to customize the char used for envelopes with at least one attachment (defaults to `@`).

### Changed

- Refactored the `account configure` command: this command stands now for creating or editing account configurations from the wizard. The command requires the `wizard` cargo feature.
- Improved the `account doctor` command: it now checks the state of the config, and the new `--fix` argument allows you to configure keyring, OAuth 2.0 etc.
- Improved long version `--version`. [#496]
- Improved error messages when missing cargo features. For example, if a TOML configuration uses the IMAP backend without the `imap` cargo features, the error `missing "imap" feature` is displayed. [#20](https://github.com/pimalaya/core/issues/20)
- Normalized enum-based configurations, using the [internally tagged representation](https://serde.rs/enum-representations.html#internally-tagged) `type =`. It should reduce issues due to misconfiguration, and improve othe error messages. Yet it is not perfect, see [#802](https://github.com/toml-rs/toml/issues/802):

  - `imap.*`, `maildir.*` and `notmuch.*` moved to `backend.*`:

	```toml
	# before
	imap.host = "localhost"
	imap.port = 143

	# after
	backend.type = "imap"
	backend.host = "localhost"
	backend.port = 143
	```

  - `smtp.*` and `sendmail.*` moved to `message.send.backend.*`:

	```toml
	# before
	smtp.host = "localhost"
	smtp.port = 25

	# after
	message.send.backend.type = "smtp"
	message.send.backend.host = "localhost"
	message.send.backend.port = 25
	```

  - `pgp.backend` renamed `pgp.type`:

	```toml
	# before
	pgp.backend = "commands"
	pgp.encrypt-cmd = "gpg --encrypt --quiet --armor <recipients>"

	# after
	pgp.type = "commands"
	pgp.encrypt-cmd = "gpg --encrypt --quiet --armor <recipients>"
	```

  - `{imap,smtp}.auth` moved as well:

    ```toml
    # before
    imap.password.cmd = "pass show example"
    smtp.oauth2.method = "xoauth2"

    # after
    backend.auth.type = "password"
    backend.auth.cmd = "pass show example"
    message.send.backend.auth.type = "oauth2"
    message.send.backend.auth.method = "xoauth2"
    ```

- Moved IMAP and SMTP `encryption` to `encryption.type`.

  This change prepares the config to accept different TLS providers with their options. The `true` and `false` variant have been removed as well:

	```toml
	# before
	backend.encryption = "none" # or false
	backend.encryption = "start-tls"
	message.send.backend.encryption = "tls" # or true

	# after
	backend.encryption.type = "none"
	backend.encryption.type = "start-tls"
	message.send.backend.encryption.type = "tls"
	```

### Fixed

- Fixed pre-release archives issue. [#492]
- Fixed mailto parsing issue. [core#10]
- Fixed `Answered` flag not set when replying to a message. [#508]

### Removed

- Removed systemd service from `assets/` folder, as Himalaya CLI scope does not include synchronization nor watching anymore.

## [1.0.0-beta.4] - 2024-04-16

### Added

- Added systemd service in `assets/` folder.
- Added configuration option `message.delete.style` that can be either `folder` (deleted messages are moved to the Trash folder, default style) or `flag` (deleted messages receive the Deleted flag).
- Added `--debug` as an alias for `RUST_LOG=debug`.
- Added `--trace` as an alias for `RUST_LOG=trace` and `RUST_BACKTRACE=1`.
- Added notes about `--debug` and `--trace` when error occurs.

### Changed

- **Added back the search feature**: you can now give an optional filter and sort query at the end of the `envelope list` command. See `envelope list --help` or [pimalaya.org](https://pimalaya.org/himalaya/cli/master/usage/advanced/envelope/list.html#query) for more detail on the search API.
- Changed the `envelope list` folder argument due to the search query: it became a flag `--folder|-f`.
- Made the global `--config|-c` option repeatable: the first option is considered the path to the main config, and successive options are considered partial overrides [#184].
- Refactored error management: error should be more clear, colored and can now contain spantrace and backtrace.
- Made `--help` content wrapping properly thanks to the `clap` cargo feature `wrap_help`.
- Improved `template {new,reply,forward}` command JSON output: they return now a JSON object with 3 properties:
  - `content`: the content of the template
  - `cursor.row`: the row at which the cursor should be placed by the interface using the template
  - `cursor.col`: the column at which the cursor should be placed by the interface using the template

### Fixed

- Fixed watch IMAP envelopes when folder was empty [#179].
- Prevented parsing of undefined config options [#188].
- Fixed `In-Reply-To` header being skipped from mailto URLs [#194].
- Fixed error page out of bounds when filtering envelopes returned an empty result [#195].

## [1.0.0-beta.3] - 2024-02-25

### Added

- Added `account check-up` command.
- Added wizard warning about google passwords [#41].

### Changed

- Removed account configurations flatten level in order to improve diagnostic errors, due to a [bug](https://github.com/toml-rs/toml/issues/589#issuecomment-1872345017) in clap. **This means that accounts need to be prefixed by `accounts`: `[my-account]` becomes `[accounts.my-account]`**. It also opens doors for interface-specific configurations.
- Rolled back cargo feature additions from the previous release. It was a mistake: the amount of features was too big, the code (both CLI and lib) was too hard to maintain. Cargo features kept: `imap`, `maildir`, `notmuch`, `smtp`, `sendmail`, `account-sync`, `account-discovery`, `pgp-gpg`, `pgp-commands` and `pgp-native`.
- Moved `sync.strategy` to `folder.sync.filter`.
- Changed location of the synchronization data from `$XDG_DATA_HOME/himalaya/<account-name>` to `$XDG_DATA_HOME/pimalaya/email/sync/<account-name>-cache`.
- Changed location of the synchronization cache from `sync.dir` to `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/pimalaya/email/sync/<hash>/`.
- Replaced id mapping database `SQLite` by `sled`, a pure key-val store written in Rust to improve portability of the tool. **Therefore, id aliases are reset**.
- Improved pre and post edit choices interaction [#58].
- Improved account synchronization performances, making it 50% faster than `mbsync` and 370% faster than `OfflineIMAP`.
- Changed `envelope.watch.{event}.{hook}`: hooks can now be cumulated. For example it is possible to send a system notification and execute a shell command when receiving a new envelope:

  ```toml
  envelope.watch.received.notify.summary = "New message from {sender}"
  envelope.watch.received.notify.body = "{subject}"
  envelope.watch.received.cmd = "echo {id} >> /tmp/new-email-counter"
  ```

### Fixed

- Fixed bug that was preventing watch placeholders to be replaced when using shell command hook.
- Fixed watch IMAP envelopes issue preventing events to be triggered.
- Fixed DNS account discovery priority issues.
- Fixed SMTP messages not properly sent to all recipients [#172].
- Fixed backend feature badly linked, leading to reply and forward message errors [#173].

## [1.0.0-beta.2] - 2024-01-27

### Added

- Added cargo feature `wizard`, enabled by default.
- Added one cargo feature per backend feature:
  - `account` including `account-configure`, `account-list`, `account-sync` and the `account-subcmd`
  - `folder` including `folder-add`, `folder-list`, `folder-expunge`, `folder-purge`, `folder-delete` and the `folder-subcmd`
  - `envelope` including `envelope-list`, `envelope-watch`, `envelope-get` and the `envelope-subcmd`
  - `flag` including `flag-add`, `flag-set`, `flag-remove` and the `flag-subcmd`
  - `message` including `message-read`, `message-write`, `message-mailto`, `message-reply`, `message-forward`, `message-copy`, `message-move`, `message-delete`, `message-save`, `message-send` and the `message-subcmd`
  - `attachment` including `attachment-download` and the `attachment-subcmd`
  - `template` including `template-write`, `template-reply`, `template-forward`, `template-save`, `template-send` and the `template-subcmd`
- Added wizard capability to autodetect IMAP and SMTP configurations, based on the [Thunderbird Autoconfiguration](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Thunderbird:Autoconfiguration) standard.
- Added back Notmuch backend features.

### Changed

- Renamed `folder create` to `folder add` in order to better match types. An alias has been set up, so both `create` and `add` still work.

### Fixed

- Fixed default command: running `himalaya` without argument lists envelopes, as it used to be in previous versions.
- Fixed bug when listing envelopes with `backend = "imap"`, `sync.enable = true` and `envelope.watch.backend = "imap"` led to unwanted IMAP connection creation (which slowed down the listing).
- Fixed builds related to enabled cargo features.

## [1.0.0-beta] - 2024-01-01

Few major concepts changed:

- The concept of *Backend* and *Sender* changed. The Sender does not exist anymore (it is now a backend feature). A Backend is now a set of features like add folders, list envelopes or send raw message. The backend of every single feature can be customized in the configuration file, which gives users more flexibility. Here the list of backend features that can be customized:
  - `backend` ***(required)***: the backend used by default by all backend features (`maildir`, `imap` or `notmuch`)
  - `folder.add.backend`: override the backend used for creating folders (`maildir`, `imap` or `notmuch`)
  - `folder.list.backend`: override the backend used for listing folders (`maildir`, `imap` or `notmuch`)
  - `folder.expunge.backend`: override the backend used for expunging folders (`maildir`, `imap` or `notmuch`)
  - `folder.purge.backend`: override the backend used for purging folders (`maildir`, `imap` or `notmuch`)
  - `folder.delete.backend`: override the backend used for deleting folders (`maildir`, `imap` or `notmuch`)
  - `envelope.list.backend`: override the backend used for listing envelopes (`maildir`, `imap` or `notmuch`)
  - `envelope.get.backend`: override the backend used for getting envelopes (`maildir`, `imap` or `notmuch`)
  - `envelope.watch.backend`: override the backend used for watching envelopes (`maildir`, `imap` or `notmuch`)
  - `flag.add.backend`: override the backend used for adding flags (`maildir`, `imap` or `notmuch`)
  - `flag.set.backend`: override the backend used for setting flags (`maildir`, `imap` or `notmuch`)
  - `flag.remove.backend`: override the backend used for removing flags (`maildir`, `imap` or `notmuch`)
  - `message.send.backend` ***(required)***: override the backend used for sending messages (`sendmail` or `smtp`)
  - `message.read.backend`: override the backend used for reading messages (`maildir`, `imap` or `notmuch`)
  - `message.write.backend`: override the backend used for adding flags (`maildir`, `imap` or `notmuch`)
  - `message.copy.backend`: override the backend used for copying messages (`maildir`, `imap` or `notmuch`)
  - `message.move.backend`: override the backend used for moving messages (`maildir`, `imap` or `notmuch`)
- The CLI API changed: every command is now prefixed by its domain following the format `himalaya <domain> <action>`. List of domain available by running `himalaya -h` and list of actions for a domain by running `himalaya <domain> -h`.
- TOML configuration file options use now the dot notation rather than the dash notation. For example, `folder-listing-page-size` became `folder.list.page-size`. See the [changed](#changed) section below for more details.

### Added

- Added cargo feature `maildir` (not plugged yet).
- Added cargo feature `sendmail` (not plugged yet).
- Added watch hooks `envelope.watch.received` (when a new envelope is received) and `envelope.watch.any` (for any other event related to envelopes). A watch hook can be:
  - A shell command: `envelope.watch.any.cmd = "mbsync -a"`
  - A system notification: 
    - `envelope.watch.received.notify.summary = "📬 New message from {sender}"`: customize the notification summary (title)
    - `envelope.watch.received.notify.body = "{subject}"`: customize the notification body (content)

	*Available placeholders: id, subject, sender, sender.name, sender.address, recipient, recipient.name, recipient.address.*
- Added watch support for Maildir backend features.

### Changed

- Renamed cargo feature `imap-backend` → `imap`.
- Renamed cargo feature `notmuch-backend` → `notmuch`.
- Renamed cargo feature `smtp-sender` → `smtp`.
- Changed the goal of the config option `backend`: it is now the default backend used for all backend features. Valid backends: `imap`, `maildir`, `notmuch`.
- Moved `folder-aliases` config option to `folder.alias(es)`.
- Moved `folder-listing-page-size` config option to `folder.list.page-size`.
- Moved `email-listing-page-size` config option to `envelope.list.page-size`.

- Moved `email-listing-datetime-local-tz` config option to `envelope.list.datetime-local-tz`.
- Moved `email-reading-headers` config option to `message.read.headers`.
- Moved `email-reading-format` config option to `message.read.format`.
- Moved `email-writing-headers` config option to `message.write.headers`.
- Move `email-sending-save-copy` config option to `message.send.save-copy`.
- Move `email-hooks.pre-send` config option to `message.send.pre-hook`.
- Moved `sync` config option to `sync.enable`.
- Moved `sync-dir` config option to `sync.dir`.
- Moved `sync-folders-strategy` config option to `sync.strategy`.
- Moved `maildir-*` config options to `maildir.*`.
- Moved `imap-*` config options to `imap.*`.
- Moved `notmuch-*` config options to `notmuch.*`.
- Moved `sendmail-*` config options to `sendmail.*`.
- Moved `smtp-*` config options to `smtp.*`.
- Replaced options `imap-ssl`, `imap-starttls` and `imap-insecure` by `imap.encryption`:
  - `imap.encryption = "tls" | true`: use required encryption (SSL/TLS)
  - `imap.encryption = "start-tls"`: use opportunistic encryption (StartTLS)
  - `imap.encryption = "none" | false`: do not use any encryption
- Replaced options `smtp-ssl`, `smtp-starttls` and `smtp-insecure` by `smtp.encryption`:
  - `smtp.encryption = "tls" | true`: use required encryption (SSL/TLS)
  - `smtp.encryption = "start-tls"`: use opportunistic encryption (StartTLS)
  - `smtp.encryption = "none" | false`: do not use any encryption

### Removed

- Disabled temporarily the `notmuch` backend because it needs to be refactored using the backend features system (it should be reimplemented soon).
- Disabled temporarily the `search` and `sort` command because they need to be refactored, see [#39].
- Removed the `notify` command (replaced by the new `watch` command).
- Removed all global options except for `display-name`, `signature`, `signature-delim` and `downloads-dir`.

## [0.9.0] - 2023-08-28

### Added

- Added 3 new cargo features:
  - `pgp-commands`: enables the commands PGP backend (enabled by default, same behaviour as before)
  - `pgp-gpg`: enables the GPG backend (requires the `gpgme` lib on the system)
  - `pgp-native`: enables the native PGP backend
- Added account configuration `pgp` to configure the way PGP operations are performed.

### Changed

- Moved `email-reading-decrypt-cmd` to `pgp-decrypt-cmd`.
- Moved `email-writing-sign-cmd` to `pgp.sign-cmd`.
- Moved `email-reading-verify-cmd` to `pgp.verify-cmd`.

## [0.8.4] - 2023-07-18

### Fixed

- Fixed windows releases due to cargo deps typo.

## [0.8.3] - 2023-07-18

### Fixed

- Fixed windows releases due to `coredump` crate compilation error.
- Fixed macos releases due to macos 12 System Integrity Protection.

## [0.8.2] - 2023-07-18

### Changed

- Made the code async using the tokio async runtime.
- On Linux, made the kernel keyring the default one (the one based on keyutils).

### Fixed

- Fixed the way folder aliases are resolved. In some case, aliases were resolved CLI side and lib side, which led to alias errors [#95].

## [0.8.1] - 2023-06-15

### Added

- Implemented OAuth 2.0 refresh token flow for IMAP and SMTP, which means that access tokens are now automatically refreshed and is transparent for users.
- Added `imap-oauth2-redirect-host` and `smtp-oauth2-redirect-host` options to customize the redirect server host name (default: `localhost`).
- Added `imap-oauth2-redirect-port` and `smtp-oauth2-redirect-port` options to customize the redirect server port (default: `9999`).
- Added `email-listing-datetime-fmt` to customize envelopes datetime format. See format spec [here](https://docs.rs/chrono/latest/chrono/format/strftime/index.html).
- Added `email-listing-local-datetime` to transform envelopes datetime's timezone to the user's local one. For example, if the user's local is set to `UTC`, the envelope date `2023-06-15T09:00:00+02:00` becomes `2023-06-15T07:00:00-00:00`.

### Fixed

- Fixed missing `<` and `>` around `Message-ID` and `In-Reply-To` headers.

## [0.8.0] - 2023-06-03

### Added

- Added keyring support, which means Himalaya can now use your system's global keyring to get/set sensitive data like passwords or tokens.
- Added required IMAP option `imap-auth` and SMTP option `smtp-auth`. Possible values: `passwd`, `oauth2`.
- Added OAuth 2.0 support for IMAP and SMTP.
- Added passwords and OAuth 2.0 configuration via the wizard.
- Added `email-sending-save-copy` option to control whenever a copy of any sent email should be saved in the `sent` folder defined in `folder-aliases`.
- Imported id mapper from the lib, which means that the id mapping is now done by the CLI.
- Added `BackendConfig` to `AccountConfig::backend` to match sender implementation.
- Added support for pipeline commands, which means commands can be either a single command (string) or piped commands (list of strings). It applies for:
  - `email-writing-verify-cmd`
  - `email-writing-decrypt-cmd`
  - `email-writing-sign-cmd`
  - `email-writing-encrypt-cmd`

### Changed

- Changed release archive extensions from `.tar.gz` to `.tgz`.
- Moved `wizard` module into domains (config, account, backend…).
- [**BREAKING**] Changed the way secrets are managed. A secret is a sensitive data like passwords or tokens. There is 3 possible ways to declare a secret in the config file:
  - `{ raw = <secret> }` for the raw secret as string (unsafe, not recommended),
  - `{ cmd = <secret-cmd> }` for command that exposes the secret,
  - `{ keyring = <secret-entry> }` for entry in your system's global keyring that contains the secret.

  This applies for:
    - `imap-passwd`
	- `imap-oauth2-client-secret`
	- `imap-oauth2-access-token`
	- `imap-oauth2-refresh-token`
    - `smtp-passwd`
	- `smtp-oauth2-client-secret`
	- `smtp-oauth2-access-token`
	- `smtp-oauth2-refresh-token`

### Fixed

- Fixed Windows releases corrupted archives.

### Removed

- [**BREAKING**] Removed `-s|--sanitize` option. It is done by default now, except if the `-t|--mime-type html` is set.
- [**BREAKING**] Removed `native-tls` support, `rustls-tls` is now the only TLS provider available. Removed in consequence `native-tls`, `rustls-tls` and `rustls-native-certs` cargo features.

## [0.7.3] - 2023-05-01

### Fixed

- Fixed Windows releases (due to typo in the github action script).
- Fixed unit tests.

## [0.7.2] - 2023-05-01

### Added

- Added `create` and `delete` folder commands [#54].
- Added generated completions and man pages to releases [#43].
- Added new account config option `sync-folders-strategy` which allows to choose a folders synchronization strategy [#59]:
  
  - `sync-folders-strategy = "all"`: synchronize all existing folders for the current account
  - `sync-folders-strategy.include = ["folder1", "folder2", …]`: synchronize only the given folders for the current account
  - `sync-folders-strategy.exclude = ["folder1", "folder2", …]`: synchronizes all folders except the given ones for the current account

  Also added new `account sync` arguments that override the account config option:
  
  - `-A|--all-folders`: include all folders to the synchronization.
  - `-F|--include-folder`: include given folders to the synchronization. They can be repeated `-F folder1 folder2` or `-F folder1 -F folder2`.
  - `-x|--exclude-folder`: exclude given folders from the synchronization. They can be repeated `-x folder1 folder2` or `-x folder1 -F folder2`.

- Added cargo features `native-tls` (default), `rustls-tls` and `rustls-native-certs`.

### Changed

- Made global options truly global, which means they can be used everywhere (not only *before* commands but also *after*) [#60].
- Replaced reply all `-a` argument with `-A` because it conflicted with the global option `-a|--account`.
- Replaced `himalaya-lib` by `pimalaya-email`.
- Renamed feature `vendored` to `native-tls-vendored`.
- Removed the `develop` branch, all the development is now done on the `master` branch.

### Fixed

- Fixed config deserialization issue with `email-hooks` and `email-reading-format`.
- Fixed flags case sensitivity.

## [0.7.1] - 2023-02-14

### Added

- Added command `folders expunge` that deletes all emails marked for deletion.
  
### Changed

- Changed the location of the [documentation](https://pimalaya.org/himalaya/).

### Fixed

- Fixed broken links in README.md.

### Removed

- Removed the `maildir-backend` cargo feature, it is now included by default.
- Removed issues section on GitHub, now issues need to be opened by sending an email at [~soywod/pimalaya@todo.sr.ht](mailto:~soywod/pimalaya@todo.sr.ht).

## [0.7.0] - 2023-02-08

### Added

- Added offline support with the `account sync` command to synchronize a backend to a local Maildir backend.
- Added the flag `--disable-cache` to not use the local Maildir backend.
- Added the email composer (from its own [repository](https://git.sr.ht/~soywod/mime-msg-builder)).
- Added Musl builds to releases.
- Added `himalaya man` command to generate man page.

### Changed

- Made commands `read`, `attachments`, `flags`, `copy`, `move`, `delete` accept multiple ids.
- Flipped arguments `ids` and `folder` for commands `copy` and `move` in order the folder not to be considered as an id.

### Fixed

- Fixed missing folder aliases.

### Removed

- Removed the `-a|--attachment` argument from `write`, `reply` and `forward` commands. Instead you can attach documents directly from the template using the syntax `<#part filename=/path/to/you/document.ext>`.
- Removed the `-e|--encrypt` flag from `write`, `reply` and `forward` commands. Instead you can encrypt and sign parts directly from the template using the syntax `<#part type=text/plain encrypt=command sign=command>Hello!<#/part>`.
- Removed the `-l|--log-level` option, use instead the `RUST_LOG` environment variable (see the [wiki](https://github.com/soywod/himalaya/wiki/Tips:debug-and-logs))

## [0.6.1] - 2022-10-12

### Added

- Added `-s|--sanitize` flag for the `read` command.
  
### Changed

- Changed the behaviour of the `-t|--mime-type` argument of the `read` command. It is less strict now: if no part is found for the given MIME type, it will fallback to the other one. For example, giving `-t html` will show in priority HTML parts, but if none of them are found it will show plain parts instead (and vice versa).
- Sanitization is not done by default when using the `read` command, the flag `-s|--sanitize` needs to be explicitly provided.

### Fixed

- Fixed empty text bodies when reading html part on plain text email.

## [0.6.0] - 2022-10-10

### Changed

- Separated the CLI from the lib module.

  The source code has been split into subrepositories:

  - The email logic has been extracted from the CLI and placed in a lib on [SourceHut](https://git.sr.ht/~soywod/himalaya-lib)	
  - The vim plugin is now in a dedicated repository on [SourceHut](https://git.sr.ht/~soywod/himalaya-vim) as well
  - This repository only contains the CLI source code (it was not possible to move it to SourceHut because of cross platform builds)

- [**BREAKING**] Renamed `-m|--mailbox` to `-f|--folder`

- [**BREAKING**] Refactored config system.

  The configuration has been rethought in order to be more intuitive and structured. Here are the breaking changes for the global config:
