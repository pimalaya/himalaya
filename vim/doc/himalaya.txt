REQUIREMENTS                                              *himalaya-requirements*

==============================================================================
USAGE                                                            *himalaya-usage* 

It is recommanded to first read the Himalaya CLI documentation {1} to understand
the concept.

To list tasks:
>
  :Himalaya
<
Then you can manage tasks using Vim mapping. The table will automatically
readjust on buffer save (`:w`). See https://github.com/soywod/himalaya.vim.

CONTRIBUTING                                              *himalaya-contributing*

Report any bugs here: https://github.com/soywod/himalaya.vim/issues
Feel free to submit pull requests: https://github.com/soywod/himalaya.vim/pulls

1) Git commit messages follow the `Angular Convention` {1}, but contain only a
subject.
>
  - Use imperative, present tense: “change” not “changed” nor “changes”
  - Don't capitalize first letter
  - No dot (.) at the end
<
2) Vim code should be as clean as possible, variables and functions use the
snake case convention. A line should never contain more than `80` characters.

3) Tests should be added for each new functionality. Be sure to run tests
before proposing a pull request.
