## Features

### [Email](https://github.com/soywod/himalaya/blob/set-up-multi-crate/email-manager/README.md)

Himalaya proposes a command-line API to manage your emails (listing, searching,
reading, copying, moving, deletingâ€¦). It is also shipped with a [Vim
plugin](https://github.com/soywod/himalaya/blob/set-up-multi-crate/email-manager/vim/README.md).
A [TUI](https://github.com/soywod/himalaya/pull/155) and an [Emacs
plugin](https://github.com/soywod/himalaya/issues/142https://github.com/soywod/himalaya/issues/142)
are in progress by the community. A
[synchronizer](https://github.com/soywod/himalaya/blob/set-up-multi-crate/email-synchronizer/README.md)
should also come soon.

*See the
[README](https://github.com/soywod/himalaya/blob/set-up-multi-crate/email-manager/README.md)
for more information abouth this tools suite.*

### Contact (TODO)

Himalaya plans to propose a command-line API to manage your contacts through
the [CardDAV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CardDAV) protocol. It may come in
the future with a Vim plugin, an Emacs plugin, a TUI and a synchronizer.

### Calendar (TODO)

Himalaya plans to propose a command-line API to manage your calendar through
the [CalDAV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CalDAV) protocol. It may come in the
future with a Vim plugin, an Emacs plugin, a TUI and a synchronizer.

### Tasks (TODO)

Himalaya plans to propose a command-line API to manage your task and your time
through the [CalDAV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CalDAV) protocol. It may
come in the future with a Vim plugin, an Emacs plugin, a TUI and a
synchronizer. The tool already exists in [another
repository](https://github.com/soywod/unfog): it needs to be rewritten and
added to the Himalaya suite.
