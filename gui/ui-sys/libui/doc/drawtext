on some unix systems, alpha blending fonts may not be available; this depends on your installed version of pango and is determined at runtime by libui

uiDrawTextLayoutExtents: document that the extent width can be greater than the requested width if the requested width is small enough that only one character can fit


font matching is closest match but the search method is OS defined


weight names in libui do not necessarily line up with their OS names


uiDrawFontHandle() may not return a unique handle per instance
