//! # Welcome to Himalaya!
//! Here's a little summary of how to read the code of himalaya:
//! Each module includes three "main" files:
//! - `model.rs`: **The "main" file** of each module which includes the main implementation of the given
//!     module.
//! - `cli.rs`: Includes the subcommands and arguments which are related to the module.
//!     
//!     For example the `read` subcommand is in the `msg/cli.rs` file because it's related to the
//!     msg you want to read.
//!
//! - `mod.rs`: Includes all other files in the module. Click [here] for more information.
