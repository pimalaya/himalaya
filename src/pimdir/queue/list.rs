/// A saved message waits in the queue until the sync engine applies it and
/// has no id until then, so `envelope list` cannot show it. A sent message
/// waits there until the store's owner sends it, filed under the mailbox it
/// was saved to or the account's sent alias. This is where both show: the
/// row id to cancel one by, when it was queued, and the mail.
///
/// Staged flags, moves and deletions need no such view, addressing messages
/// that already exist. A row of any kind the sync engine parked, refusing to
/// apply it without an operator, is listed `parked` with why: cancel it, or
/// fix what parked it. A move or a deletion of a message a sync left in
/// conflict parks so, listed in the mailbox the message stays in. One the
/// engine sent without learning its outcome is listed `unconfirmed`
/// instead: it may have taken effect.
