REQUIREMENTS                                           *himalaya-requirements* 

  - Vim or Neovim
  - Himalaya CLI {1}
                           https://github.com/soywod/himalaya#installation {1}

==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION                                         *himalaya-configuration* 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MAILBOX PICKER PROVIDER
>
  let g:himalaya_mailbox_picker = 'native' | 'fzf' | 'telescope'
<
Defines the provider used for picking mailboxes:

- `native`: a vim native input
- `fzf`: https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim
- `telescope`: https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim

If no value given, the first loaded (and available) provider will be used (fzf
> telescope > native).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TELESCOPE PREVIEW
>
  let g:himalaya_telescope_preview_enabled = 0
<
Should enable telescope preview when picking a mailbox with the telescope
provider.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CONTACT COMPLETION
>
  let g:himalaya_complete_contact_cmd = '<your completion command>'
<
Define the command to use for contact completion. When this is set,
'completefunc' will be set when composing messages so that contacts can be
completed with |i_CTRL-X_CTRL-U|.

The command must print each possible result on its own line. Each line must
contain tab-separated fields; the first must be the email address, and the
second, if present, must be the name. `%s` in the command will be replaced
with the search query.

For example, to complete contacts with khard, you could use
`khard email --remove-first-line --parsable '%s'` as the completion command.

==============================================================================
